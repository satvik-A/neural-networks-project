# Neural Networks: Optimizing Performance with Adaptive Activation Functions

This project is dedicated to enhancing neural network performance through the use of adaptive parametric activation functions.


## Overview

This repository is designed to explore and implement adaptive parametric activation functions to increase the performance of convolutional neural networks especially on long-tailed datasets where the accuracy of rare-class samples is increased.

### 4. `modifications`
Contains modified implementations and utilities for adaptive activation functions where we modified the existing adaptive activation function ie. APA and developed a hybrid activation module combining APA, AdAct-style hinges, and frequency-conditioned parameters, resulting in a more flexible and adaptive network. Frequency-Conditioned parameters dynamically adjust activation steepness (κ) based on input frequency content.

$\text{HybridAPA}(z) = (\lambda e^{-\kappa z} + 1)^{-1/\lambda} + \sum_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \max(0, z - h)$


where

$$
\kappa = \kappa_{\text{base}} + \alpha \cdot \text{FFT-Mag}(z)
$$

and

$$
\mathcal{H} = \{0.2, 0.5, 0.8\}
$$

- $\kappa$ is the frequency-adapted steepness.
- $\mathcal{H}$ are the learnable hinge thresholds.
- $\lambda$ is the asymmetry parameter.
- $\text{FFT-Mag}(z)$ is the average magnitude of the FFT of $z$.
